		<p><center><h3>Our restaurant is based of of the mexican grill Qdoba. But we didn't like Qdoba, becuase who does? So we made our own improved Qdoba, named Chipetlo. Chipetlo is a new mexican grill. We think it is amazing. Critics rate it 4.9 out of 5 stars. Some even said it was a 6 out of 5, becuase it was so good. But don't just take our word for it.</h3></center></p>

		<p><h3>As you can see, people really like our burittos. In fact they're so good, that we are deciding to make an interactive buritto builder on thi very website. That is right. No buttons or selecting your things. You get to draw your very own buritto!</p></h3>
